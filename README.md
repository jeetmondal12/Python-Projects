## Usage Examples

### Jarvis

1.  Navigate to the `Jarvis` directory:

    ```bash
    cd Jarvis
    ```

2.  Before running the script, you need a Google Gemini API key. Sign up and obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).

3. Set the API key in the `main.py` file.

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    The script will listen for voice commands.

### Todo

1.  Navigate to the `Todo` directory:

    ```bash
    cd Todo
    ```

2.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Follow the prompts in the command line to add, view, and mark tasks as done.

### Chatbot

1.  Navigate to the `chatbot` directory:

    ```bash
    cd chatbot
    ```

2.  Before running the script, you need a Google Gemini API key. Sign up and obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).

3.  Set the API key in the `gemini.py` file (replace `xxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual API key).

4.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python gemini.py
    ```

    You can start chatting with the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. Type "exit", "quit", or "bye" to end the chat.

## Configuration Options

*   **Gemini API Key:** The `Jarvis/main.py` and `chatbot/gemini.py` scripts require a valid Google Gemini API key. Replace the placeholder with your actual API key obtained from Google AI Studio.
